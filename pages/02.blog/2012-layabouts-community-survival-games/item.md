On Saturday May 5th, a few members of the Layabouts Community got together and played the first and second Survival Games maps by Vareide. These are our stories.

The playlist goes through both maps, in order from the last placed POV to the first place. Sadly not all POVs are available, and only my view of both maps, *Evil Plot Plays* member Casey's POVs of both maps, and Phil's view of the first are shown. Sorry!
