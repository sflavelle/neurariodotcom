Week 4 of UGC Highlander Australia. Haven't uploaded any match POVs since then since, IMO, we kinda got rolled. Here I don't have much to do besides defend the point and try and pick off targets.

This team has made some improvement since we last scrimmed against them - I couldn't get right in and do some damage like I'd hoped, especially thanks to their scout and sniper.
