Here's another failed LP for you all - the Prophecies campaign in Guild Wars. The reason for this one is that...Well, actually, I don't quite remember.

I do remember that I wasn't sure how I wanted to edit it - and that with Guild Wars 2 on the way, it might not have been as interesting. I may try this again in the future, though!
