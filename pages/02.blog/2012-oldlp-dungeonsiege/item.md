This was an LP series I really wanted to do, but couldn't because I was still having a very big problem of "what to talk about". What **could** I talk about, though? After explaining a bit of the game's mechanics, I would need to submit myself to a lot of fighting and standard RPG fare which most people already know about, possibly don't care for.

As much as I enjoy playing the game itself, there's not much to talk about, and not much to grip the player, in my own opinion, besides the game's few cutscenes. So, off to the bin it goes!

Original text below:

*Simon begins his biggest LP yet! Down in the Kingdom of Ehb, something's gone wrong and it's up to Simon to find out what's going on. On this first episode, in his journey to the Crypt of the Sacred Blood, he explains some of the game's mechanics.*

*As this is going to be a long series, I'd like to know your thoughts on my editing, the game itself, anything you guys would like to see from this LP. If you like the content and want to see more, feel free to subscribe (god i feel dirty saying that) or bookmark the series playlist below!*
