I always love seeing what people do with the tools that we have nowadays to export data from Minecraft to programs like Blender, 3DS Max, Cinema 4D, and similar programs, not for animation (though that happens too), but to pretty up the world with custom materials and effects to really make it stand out.

I've been looking at a couple from reddit ([mcobj](http://www.reddit.com/r/mcobj) and [jmc2obj](http://www.reddit.com/r/jmc2obj)) and I'm getting inspired to try and do my own again, especially after seeing some of *The Pixel Artist*'s work.

There's one particular type of render I would love to do, but it would probably require a lot of patience and RAM: "world" renders (that is my own term), or renders that show a large portion of the Minecraft world, rather than one structure or whathaveyou. It looks beautiful.

[This is one I did last night](http://db.tt/g4PUTGDS), of the Central Artania spawn on the [Layabouts](http://www.wearethelayabouts.com/) Minecraft Server. I was simply experimenting with a new rendering engine so I didn't define many of the materials, but the result still looks great, and I think I will do more of this kind of thing.
