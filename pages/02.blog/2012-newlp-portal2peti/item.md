Welcome to the new LP!

The Perpetual Testing Initiative will be (for now) an ongoing series where I showcase the top rated levels, as well as show off some levels coming from the [Layabouts Community](http://community.wearethelayabouts.com/).

This first video shows how you can make your own levels!
