As of this Halloween, I'm glad to report that Nate, Joe, Phil, Briguy and Jack have successfully made it to *The End* and defeated the Ender Dragon! With some casualties, but oh well!

Keep in mind that that's not the end of our journey - it's just a milestone! We'll still be [making updates](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLngPAEUQRS97CSQYQB6U6wwg3OOV2DG_L) - and there are still more strongholds to find!
