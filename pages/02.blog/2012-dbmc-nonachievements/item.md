A trend I noticed recently on our server, beginning with Briguy, is the "Achievement Wall". This wall hosts our important accomplishments for the world and other players to see.

I don't believe I have such accomplishments. Or if I do, I still like to poke fun at the concept, and hence this wall in my home is begun.

Check out the [series playlist](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi8u-iSlRsHVUXa8HQq06X3xCLuO8h8am) if you want to learn when these happened.
