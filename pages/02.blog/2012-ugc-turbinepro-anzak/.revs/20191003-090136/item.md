Debated whether or not to put this one up. Ultimately in this one I didn't really do my job of trying to get the intel, and instead attempted to distract the enemy with Bonk that hardly worked (except in one case) and pretty much spectated half the match while waiting to respawn. I didn't know what I was supposed to be doing until the second part of the match when it was too late and even then I didn't really /do/ it.

I guess I could complain a shitload about what I did or didn't do but I'm just going to let this stay here as an example of what can go wrong when you don't communicate effectively.
