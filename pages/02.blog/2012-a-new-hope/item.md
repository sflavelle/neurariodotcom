**Hi, everybody!**

So GetMyVPS shut down, leaving my site mostly out of commission for a while. This is mostly a test post for a new blog system that I can manage with Dropbox called [Scriptogr.am](http://www.scriptogr.am).

As you can see, it is very minimalist, and that's fine! Blog posts and pages are made as individual files, and everything uses [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for formatting. It's something to get used to, but let's see how it all goes.

I'll probably use this blog for anything, but of course let's see what actually happens, hmm?
