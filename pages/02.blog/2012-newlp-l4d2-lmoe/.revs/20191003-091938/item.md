The "Last Man on Earth" mutation pits the single player (Me, in this case) against the Infected, minus the regular infected and Boomers. I need to be careful as I can very easily be incapacitated, but after they do so I am allowed to get up again, albeit in "black and white mode". After that, if they manage to hit me again and I haven't healed, I'm done for!

This time around, Simon takes to Soviet Russia in the recreations of iconic places from the movie/game "Goldeneye". This video only covers the first half of the campaign, "Facility" and "Archives/Depot".
