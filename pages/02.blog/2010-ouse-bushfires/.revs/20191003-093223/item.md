For a week now, since a very hot day in Tasmania (34C, dry air, no moisture) there have been a couple bushfires burning around our state, mainly around the Central Highlands. The first I knew of it, there was only one source; from the hills just behind the paddock. Smoke had covered the sun, things were cast in a yellow tinge, and we were worried.

Soon the smoke began to lift from the paddock side of the horizon, and it became apparent that there was another source of smoke - to the west, behind our house, where smoke was pouring. We couldn't see a fire, but it proved that the trees and houses in that direction did NOT aid our vision. We had heard that it was around three kilometres from our town (though the next day we realised it had come within a kilometer of the school) and we made some quick preparations to leave, if we had to.

The main problem was that, being a book business, we were positively loaded with flammable material; it was in pallets in our back yard, in the office, etc. Barely having had any rain, the grass was dry. Being in a family of four other children, there was stuff littered over our yard - toys, tools, even the occasional dish. If the fire touched us, we would go up in flames so quickly.

But we were safe. We kept an eye out while Mum occasionally checked on the Tasmanian Fire Service site for updates, we watched firetrucks race up and down the main street, people were crying. It was quite chaotic. I couldn't sleep that night. I didn't want to. We would continue to check on the site, and at one point it had even crashed. It was one of the only times that month I had had my window open, to watch out for the faint orange glow behind us. Eventually I did go to sleep.

The next day was spent cleaning the entire back yard, packing away book pallets into the shipping container we own, making sure all the stuff that could burn, was safe. We trimmed everywhere, and all the while kept an eye on the Fire site. Overnight it had spread pretty much all the way to Wayatinah, a town north of us, and was now quite big. While the fire didn't reach us today, we were still fully aware we might have to leave or be evacuated at any time. While the fire didn't reach us, we (Me, Mum, and Dad) spent an hour or so watching over the fire that had now sprung up around Lake Repulse, and the orange glow was quite visible in the night. While we didn't see any fire, we were mostly prepared for what it might throw at us. Though, we still had many pallets to pack away.

Monday was one of the most intense days of the fire for Ouse. It came back south, and smoke poured behind the line of trees west of our house, in the distance. Again, it didn't appear to touch the town, but the massive smoke stack, the tinge and color of it threatened us. We kept an eye on it the entire time we were outside, and while we did it almost seemed like the Repulse fire wouldn't die, tendrils of smoke rising from where it used to be.

Tuesday and Wednesday was full of the same weather, although the fire had mostly disappeared from the view of our house. The smoke hadn't, though. It had now spread behind the nearby hill, and almost looked to have joined with the Repulse fire at one point. By now though, life for the Flavelle family had returned to normal, occasionally checking the TFS site.

Thursday was one of the most promising days we had that night. RAIN! REAL, HARD, HONEST-TO-GOODNESS RAIN! I thought it was sure to be the end of most of the fire. I was wrong. But I didn't know this until the next day.

At 9PM, I noticed an orange glow within our own town. First thought: oh shit. I let Mum and Dad know, and they walked around to take a better look. I was asked to stay home and I watched as the fire in the back of somebody's yard seemed to get worse, dark clouds puffing from it. Some time later the parents came back. Their verdict; somebody was burning off. They had not been able to dispose of their garbage at all, and so in a desperate attempt they tried to burn it during the rain, so people would not notice. Ladies and Gentlemen; we had been living in paranoia for the past week. I say; WHAT THE HELL. There is no reason that you should be burning off while there are OTHER bushfires burning around. Without a permit, too. If just ONE spark wavered into somebody else's yard... I probably wouldn't be here telling you guys this story.

Friday, we find the rain had caused more problems then perhaps it fixed. Though it appeared the fire has definitely moved away from Ouse. Maybe to return another day? Perhaps. It doesn't appear to be our problem anymore, though.

Throughout the course of this week, there have been helicopters, police-/fire-men, worried residents and quite possibly some arsons who are the cause of these bushfires. I don't know if any lives are lost, or any property, and I don't know all the information that has come from my Dad's mouth, as he has helped lend some insight into the workings of some minds, but this is how much I can recall, from memory, of the past week.

I'd like to thank all of my internet friends for their support, as well as ABC Hobart and the Tasmanian Fire Service for THEIR coverage of the bushfires, the former's Twitter account, who followed me and who I retweeted a lot of info about the latest fire events from. And the brave firemen of the Central Highlands, without which we would all be in serious danger.

...it's been a rough week.
