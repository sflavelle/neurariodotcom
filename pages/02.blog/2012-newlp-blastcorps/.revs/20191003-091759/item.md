In this game you represent the expert demolition company "Blast Corps", who is called in to prevent a national incident by clearing a path through metropolitan and country areas, for a US nuclear missile carrier locked on for a straight-ahead course! You will use various vehicles and tools to accomplish the goal, and unlock a few minigames to test your skill.

In episode one, we take our first steps into the game and its mechanics, and go through some training with a few of the vehicles we will use.
