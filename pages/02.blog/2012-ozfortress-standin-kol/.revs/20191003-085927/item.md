To make up for the last match we made sure to have a strategy, going into this odd map. And executed it quite well ensuring a three-point win quite quickly. My job, in the map where you need to hold all three points to win, is to capture one of the other side points (with the sniper, TJFS, assisting me) and flank the enemy when possible.
