>DJ Octavio knows exactly how to get Agent 5 to give in to her desires.

!!! WIP! May never be finished (I sure hope it does, though)

===

“...Lily.”

“Octavio, I’m sorry, we need to move, *now*.” Lily slipped her headset on and quickly checked to make sure she had all of her gear on.

“Lily. *I* called you here.” Octavio’s voice called, with the slightest hint of a tease in his deep voice, beneath the uncomfortable sound of glass rubbing, sliding on rock. “What if I could persuade you to stay?”

...*Huh?* Lily turned around to face him. “Another time, ma--...”

DJ Octavio held the glass of his prison with two tentacles, and stared at her through open space with a smirk.

Wait. Open space?

Lily’s blood ran cold.

*DJ Octavio was free.*

Lily rushed toward his cage, weapon up. “Oh no no no no. Octavio, you can’t--!”

As soon as Lily got close enough to him, the two tentacles that had forced up the glass bulb had shot for her hands, pushing them apart and smacking them against the glass, causing her to reflexively drop her weapons.

Lily’s Dualies clattered to the floor.

Having disarmed her, the King followed up by reaching around with another tentacle and pulling her head forward and up close to his, his great eyes staring into hers.

Lily gulped, her thoughts running wild. *What was he doing…?*

One more tentacle gently brushed down Lily’s front. “*Hey.* So I just freed up your evening, and I can finally touch again.”

She blushed hard, struggling slightly, unsure of just what he had in mind. “I-I can see that…”

“Soooo, I was wondering, my dear Lily…” He seemed to smirk, and his exploring tentacle reached her waist and slithered under her shirt, slowly making its way back up, teasing her. “How would you like to spend a night with the King~? Indulging *all* our desires…” He pulled her head even closer to his, enough that her face brushed against his, and she could almost only see the blacks of his pupils.

Lily knew exactly what he wanted. They had both flirted with each other, and flirted with the idea that she was open to having sex with him. It was one thing when they were separated by glass and he, a villainous octopus with *very real* tentacles, was restrained. And Lily had to reluctantly admit that he did *kinda* turn her on.

But it was quite another thing to be exposed to him like this, with nothing between them- and judging by the way he was already sliding that playful tentacle up to her chest, that would soon include her clothes. Slightly panicked, she stammered, “H-here? Now?!”

“Here…” He whispered, gently loosening his grip and retracting his tentacle from her shirt as he slid back into the snowglobe, the dome still tilted to one side. He beckoned her toward him with the flick of his appendage. “And, if you take off that Agent gear and get in here with me… *Now~*”

The inkling took deep breaths, staring at him. *Oh boy…* 

She knew that she shouldn’t. What would her friends think?

But she knew that she wanted him, at least a little bit. And a night of kink exploration, unloading nearly a year’s worth of sexual tension between them, seemed inevitable.

Lily bit her lip, and looked down at her hoodie. Now that this was suddenly happening, she felt ashamed of her inexperience… “O-Octavio, um… I… want to, but uh… You should know I uh… I’ve never, er…” She sighed, and closed her eyes. “I’ve never.”

DJ Octavio seemed to grin. “Oh, my. Isn’t *that* interesting. So does that mean, then…” He leaned back in the snowglobe’s dome, relaxed. “...that I get to claim your inkling virginity, my dear~? Don’t worry… I’ll be gentle. At first~”

“Uh…” With one last moment of hesitation, she began to remove her headset and hoodie. “Y-Yeah. Let’s go with that…” The hoodie unzipped easily, and she tossed it aside. She undid the latch on her boots and stepped out of them.

Octavio watched intently, looking over her body with some interest. Sure, she *looked* like an inkling, but he was always fascinated with the bodies of octolings, of either gender - their muscles, the structure of their forms, their limbs, their genitalia even - and while Lily wasn’t all that muscular, and even was slightly pudgy, she reminded him of them - and of how he *loved* getting his tentacles on them, how they loved submitting to him, giving their body to him.

And as Lily’s bare chest popped free from underneath the shirt she was discarding, he knew he’d love making *her* submit to him, too. “Mmmmm. What a lovely form, my Lily.”

“T-thank you…” With a blush, her hands went to the waistband on her shorts.

“Ah-ah. Don’t.” Octavio smirked, waggling an appendage at her. “Come on in, and let *me* take care of that for you.”

Lily’s blush deepened as she slowly nodded, reaching forward for the snowglobe opening and climbing in. As she did, Octavio grabbed the glass around the opening with powerful suction cups, and with a grunt and a great tug, the opening was pulled back toward the ground, lining up with the grooves that were *supposed* to hold it in.

And like that, Lily was trapped inside the snowglobe, at Octavio’s mercy.

The inkling glanced around at the space she was now trapped inside. It seemed much smaller from inside than she initially thought, though that was probably because Octavio was taking up the rest of that space. As his tentacles wrapped around her once again, he lifted himself from the ground, bringing himself closer, closer to her.

Lily didn’t fight it. She leaned into him even, adjusting herself to get comfortable and allowing herself to enjoy his warmth as two of the tentacles embraced her. She found her face pressed against his, and more specifically her mouth next to his, hidden behind that odd moustache, and so to let herself get into the mood, she gave him a quick, soft kiss.

“Heh. How adorable.” The DJ eyed her up before seemingly deciding ‘why not’ and responding in kind, and the two shared a kiss as he leaned more of his weight against her, and two tentacles snaked up her front to cup and caress her breasts, eliciting a soft groan from her. *Oh, this was going to be /fun/*, he thought.

She closed her eyes and relaxed as his appendages caressed and held her body, feeling gentle tugs from his many suckers on her body, and especially around her chest. Every now and then the suckers on the tips of his tentacles would slide over her nipples and pull hard, causing her to shiver and moan underneath him. *Holy shit, already this feels nothing like I was expecting…* “Nngh… D-DJ~” she breathed into his lips.

“Yes~?” He was loving this, and especially enjoying how easily she was letting him do as he pleased now. As DJ Octavio’s various arms curled around, brushed over and suckled over her body, one more tentacle at his front slid into action, rubbing between her hips and up her belly. This was smaller, and a little rougher, and kinked in odd places.

Lily tensed as the new tentacle brushed against her nethers. Her shorts felt so tight… This was getting so real… She glanced down between their bodies at the tentacle teasing her pussy. This tentacle looked stranger to her, smaller and yet… “W-what is that one…?”

Octavio grinned at her, breaking the kiss as he ground it harder against her nethers. “It’s the one that matters~,” he teased as he toyed with her. “The one that’s gonna fill you right up~”

Lily’s cheeks burned a deep red at his response. She thought she might know the technical name… *But let’s just call it what it is - that’s his dick rubbing against me…* “N-nngaaah… Tavi, *please…*”

“Ah-ah.” Octavio lifted it away, along with the two on her breasts. “You have to promise.”

“Mmh?” Her eyes shot up to his nervously. “P-promise…?”

“Mmmhm~” He grinned down at her, and pressed his weight further against her, pressing her more firmly against the glass. “You have to promise that I *own* you, human~”

“...*own* me?”

“That’s right.” He grinned. “Just say the words, and I will mate you until I have nothing left to give. You want that too, don’t you~?”

“Y-yes…” Lily’s body felt hot, and horny, and god - he really had her like putty in the palm of his metaphorical hands. At that moment, she wanted nothing more. “Fine…”

“Say it…~” He dangled his tentacles above her, waiting to strike.

Lily’s cheeks burned hard. “I… My… body is yours, DJ Octavio. You own me, my-- Nngaaahh~!”

The moment he’d heard what he wanted to hear, a tentacle plunged itself into her shorts, grinding hard over her pussy, its tip sliding underneath and up between her asscheeks, rubbing against her rear entrance as well. “Good girl~ Let’s get rid of these~” Simultaneously, the two tentacles that had been giving her chest so much attention dove for the elastic of her shorts, deftly sliding them down her legs before casually tossing them aside. He made quick work of the pink panties she was wearing too, simply tearing them to shreds.

Lily squirmed and let out a loud moan as Octavio teased and ground over her sensitive bits, quickly stripping her down and leaving her naked. She couldn’t stop herself from grinding back, pressing her nub into his tentacles. The two of them huffed and groaned, both very much into the situation they’d created for themselves.

And then he lifted her up by the legs, spreading them and pressing her more against the wall of the glass dome, and teased the tip of his tentacle along her entrance. They both glanced down at her mound as Lily pressed her arms back into the glass for stability, then back up at each other.

“Are you ready, my pet~?” Octavio said softly.

“Yes…” Lily quietly whispered. “D-do it…”

With a nod, and leaning into her, the octopus slid his tentacle inside.

Slowly, as she clenched down on him, the appendage slid deeper, growing thicker and spreading her walls the more it slid in. Lily was surprised to hear a deep groan and shiver from him - it took her a moment to realise he’d been deprived of this for a long time too.

Indeed, it didn’t take long before he was thrusting that tentacle roughly inside her, breathing heavily and almost humping his body against her. “Haah… Lily…”

Lily, overwhelmed with the new sensations, held onto him as he plunged into her again and again.
