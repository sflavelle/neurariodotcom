>Lily and Pearl have a chat. Pearl and Marina have a chatroom.

===

"Marina, we've been keeping watch for *eeever*. Just wake her up
already."

"It's been like half an hour, you two. You don't take a hit like that
and just get back up right away..."

Light streamed in from the open end of the sewer tunnel not too far away
from the group that sat just inside. Marina and (reluctantly) Eight had
carried Lily's unconscious body away from the Square to a more secluded
part of the system. A facility they had passed, built into the sewer
tunnels, filtered the ink from the flows, and clear water and oil now
emptied from here into the canals just ahead.

Initially, the plan was just to question the human where they were. But
after a close encounter with an Inkling up on the surface nearly
stumbling upon them, they had decided to move further up, to where the
tunnels joined the main canal.

"Yeah, but we got *things* to do! We can't just sit around like this!
Why don't we just chuck her in the canal and call it a day?"

Marina looked up from browsing through Lily's iPhone. "Pearl, that's
called murder." She had discovered the fingerprint lock mechanism, and
had figured it out enough to try unlocking the phone with Lily's thumbs.
Naturally, it had worked. Now she sat next to the unconscious Inkling as
she looked through random applications and messages, wishing she could
understand the text...

"And? Marina, she's *human*, remember?" Pearl turned her back to the
tunnel entrance and faced the Octos. "She doesn't *belong* in this
world."

"No, she doesn't. But at the same time..." Marina paused to think. "No,
I can't allow it. I wanna know what she has to say first. Then if
there's any way to send her back..."

"Well, at least wake her up, yo! I'm tired of waiting around!"

Marina sighed. "Well, perhaps some of those strong smelling salts would
do the trick... I didn't think to bring any with me, and I think that's
probably the quickest way to do that. I can go back and get some, if you
and Eight will watch Lily."

"Yeah, okay. We can handle her." Pearl nodded, already forming a plan.
"We've got this!"

"Great. Alright." Marina stood up, having knelt and examined Lily
carefully. "I'll be back shortly, alright? Fifteen minutes, max." She
started to jog back into the tunnel, waving back at Pearl and Agent
Eight.

Pearl waved until her bandmate had disappeared behind a corner, then
turned to Eight. "She's got a point, Eight, but we can't afford to waste
time on this. Who knows what'll happen, eh? I know just how to wake her
up. Watch this."

Pearl pulled out her Dualies as she approached Lily's body, straddling
her. She watched her face quietly for a few moments, noticing she had
gone into a regular sleep. Then she raised her right hand and smacked
the side of one of the Dualies against Lily's temple.

The low groan from the Inkling told Pearl what she wanted to know - she
was waking.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lily was smacked awake some unknown time after being knocked out. Her
head seared with pain from the earlier blow and her vision swam briefly
as she tried to make sense of where she was.

"Oy. Eyes up here." Someone in white was standing in front of her. She
blinked her eyes a few times, and they came into focus.

It was Pearl. And she was aiming a pair of Splat Dualies right at her.

She seemed to have been dragged up against the wall of the sewer tunnel.
She guessed that she may have been too heavy to be moved away from the
sewers, but she was now not too far off from the end of the underground
tunnel. Her hands were also bound behind her back.

The Octoling boy was with them, to her left - he had his own weapon,
Splattershot-like, also aimed at her.

Lily sighed, and closed her eyes. "Well? What's the hold-up? Do it
already."

"Nuh uh," Pearl said with a smirk. "It's time to talk."

Grumbling, Lily looked around for other options. Maybe she could get
herself into the ink river, assuming it didn't hurt, and get to safety
that way? She focused for a moment, turning into a squid before they
knew what was happening.

Except that she couldn't.

For whatever reason, the vibrations of the device that still rumbled on
her back were  preventing her from changing.

"Hey, what the?" Lily exclaimed. "What did you do to me?!"

Pearl smirked. "Eight tells me a Disruptor basically stops the target
from changing forms while it's active. So no way you're going squid
around us. And," she let a bit of teeth show, stepping a bit closer,
"that does mean you won't be allowed to respawn if you're a bad human.
So you better behave, yeah?"

Lily thought about this. "That... basically means I'll die, right?"

"Oh would you look at that." The smirk grew ever-wider. "I guess humans
*are* somewhat intelligent."

"Why, Pearl?" Lily sighed, watching the Dualie barrels carefully. "Why
are you guys so angry and scared of me? I swear I'm not dangerous..."

"You know exactly why, human. I guess it's too bad your little toy
statue didn't kill us all, huh? 'Cuz now we're gonna take our revenge on
you."

Lily's face dropped, and her brows furrowed in confusion. *Oh... this is
gonna suck...*

"Alright kid, 'fess up." Pearl pressed the barrel of one of her Dualies
against Lily's forehead. "Why are you here?"

"... Fine," Lily finally said, and her body slumped in defeat. "I'm
*here* to rebuild my life, fuck you very much. Since I was so *rudely*
pulled out of my own time. I don't know why I *got* here, though. I
honestly don't."

"Why?" The barrel pressed into her forehead more firmly, leaving a mark.

"Because I don't even know *how* I got here. What I do know makes no
sense."

"Tell us."

Lily stared up at Pearl with a scowl. "Fell down a ravine, probably to
my death, suddenly was above Octo Valley." Her eyes narrowed.
"No. Fucking. Sense."

"I'm not sure I believe you... *human*."

"Much as I really despise what you're doing, I've no reason to lie." One
brief moment later, she revised: "Not *anymore*."

Pearl slowly, cautiously, eased the Dualie barrel off of Lily's head.
"Then turn back. Show me what you really look like."

Lily shook her head. "God damnit Pearl, that's impossible. Humans can't
shape-shift."

"Bullshit! Why are you disguised as an Inkling then?"

"I'm not disguised... I *am* an Inkling now. I thought you would have
asked Sheldon that. I heard you had quite the chat with my friends." She
sighed. "Cephalopods have been evolving without us for hundreds,
thousands, I dunno, millions of years? Your ink as a defense mechanism
has a much more violent reaction to humans now. I got changed because I
landed in ink."

"That sounds ridiculous."

"I realise. But everything else has evolved with you guys. We haven't."

"And what does this have to do with NILS?"

"...What's NILS? Pardon?"

"Don't be daft! We know you worked with Tartar to try to kill us all and
give humans back the world!"

Lily just stared at her. "...What the *fuck* are you on about, Pearl?!
I've no idea what either of those things are! I don't want to
destroy---"

"SHUT IT!" Pearl's Dualie muzzles pressed firmly against Lily's head,
and the human-Inkling saw the other's fingers rest on the triggers.
"That's enough. Ya done, son."

Lily sighed, and closed her eyes. As she waited for Pearl to make a
move, almost hoping for Pearl to open fire on her, she wondered what
death would feel like...

"Lily! Hang on!"

"Don't come any closer!" Pearl and Eight stood up, training their
weapons in the direction of the voice, further into the darkness of the
sewer tunnels. Lily also looked over, hopeful.

At first, they didn't see anything.

Then two figures came around the corner, not too far away, coming
towards them. The first was clearly Marina, and she *had* brought some
smelling salts to awaken Lily.

But Marina had led someone to them. And judging by the custom Brella
pointed at her back, not by choice. She looked ashamed as her eyes met
Pearl's.

The person behind Marina...

Pearl's hearts sank.

The intruder's face dropped as she came closer, and her brandished
custom Brella lowered slightly. Her eyes darted from Pearl, to Lily, to
the Octoling boy in gear similar to, but not quite like, Octavio's own
forces.

"No..." Marie breathed in shock. "I would never have believed you,
*both* of you, would be working with the enemy."

Marina blinked, and swapped glances with her friends, the color draining
from her face. "M-Marie... No... We..."

"Let go of her and step aside. Now." Marie refocused her Brella on
Marina. "Don't make me use this on her..."

"I can't believe you're working with the human!" Pearl spat, raising her
Dualies again *at Marie*.

"Pearlie! Stop!" Marina gasped out. She was caught in the middle of this
standoff. This was not a situation she wanted to be in.

"Yes, I am!" Marie slowly stepped towards them, keeping her Brella up,
pushing Marina forward. "I don't know why you're spreading these rumors,
but I will personally vouch for her credibility!"

Pearl seemed taken aback by the accusation. "They aren't rumors!" she
cried out. "We saw the threat with our own eyes! We *stopped* the
threat, for goodness sake! We're stopping her before the humans try
again to wipe us all out for good! *Including* you, Marie!"

"You're being ridiculous. What about him?" Marie pointed her weapon at
Eight, and Eight reflexively trained his weapon on her. "Don't try it,
octoslob."

"He's on our side!" Pearl yelled. "I mean, he's on your side. I mean..."

"He's a refugee," clarified Marina. "We helped him escape, and start a
new life! What we went through to get him here is *why* we're so
concerned about the human!"

"Why are you telling her?!" hissed Pearl in Marina's direction.

"She needs to know the *facts*," Marina replied, facing her but clearly
addressing Marie. "To know just what she has sided with."

"I know exactly who I've sided with, thanks." Marie inched the two of
them closer, at least until the Octo boy raised his weapon again. "And
she is nothing like I have heard from you both. I'd know, I found the
poor girl in the first place."

"You WHAT?!" Pearl yelled at her, astounded. "*You* are the one that
unleashed Tartar upon us?!"

"I didn't unle--- wait, who?" Marie furrowed her brows. *Who on
earth...?* "Who the heck is Tartar? I only know a Lily." She nodded at
the body sat on the ground. "And she's been with me or A--- ...or her
friend Lorne ever since she got here. You don't truly believe *me* to be
working against Inkopolis, do you?"

"Well... n-no but... humans---"

"Are extinct now." Marie tried to put on a friendlier voice. She hoped
she would be able to get them to at least stand down... "Yes, one has
survived, somehow. But from all of my time working and hanging out with
her, she has been the complete opposite of what you have said humans are
like." She sighed. "Even if humans do somehow become a threat in the
future, I assure you that she will not be one of them. She's embraced
her new life, as *one of us*. Now lower your weapons and let me treat
her."

"You first," Pearl said firmly, not entirely convinced.

"I'll put my weapon down if you do," Marie offered.

Pearl sighed. "Let Marina go and we'll do it."

Marie rolled her eyes. "I won't let her go *free*, but I'll let her
return over to you." She nudged the idol in their direction and, slowly,
Marina got the hint, crossing the gap between them, returning to Pearl
and Eight.

Pearl nodded. "Fine... We'll all go on three."

Marie nodded, and slowly began to lower the Brella, watching Pearl and
Eight carefully. "One... Two..."

Both Pearl and Eight reluctantly began to drop their weapons to their
side.

"Three."

Marie's Brella hung limply from her hand, as did Pearl's Dualies and
Eight's Octoshot.

"Much better." Marie closed the distance between them cautiously, and
knelt down before Lily's form, examining her bruises and squeezing her
hand comfortingly. Now that Marie was up close with her, she noticed
that her clothes were rough and worn from being dragged against the
concrete for such a long distance.

"So... what's *actually* going on, then?" Marina quietly asked. "Who is
she?"

Marie looked at the three of them silently before answering, "She was
brought here against her will. I was the one who found her, so... we
became friends. I've been helping her settle into the city with the help
of Sheldon and Lorne. That's all I feel comfortable saying for now,
especially after this stunt you've pulled."

She stood up, turning to them. "Now I strongly recommend you three go
back to whatever you were doing before you decided to terrorize this
poor girl. I'll be taking her back to her place. Come on, Lily, up you
get..." She bent down briefly to help the pained Inkling slowly get to
her feet. "We'll chat about this some other time, girls. And I expect
your full co-ordination from now on." They started to walk down the
sewer path, back the way they had came.

Pearl, Marina, and Eight stared after her as she left, then looked at
each other.

"Oh, and Marina..."

"Yes... Marie?"

"If I hear that you've started working for Octavio again, I *will* be
back. *We* will be back. Am I clear?"

"...Yes, Marie. No chance of that happening."

"Good. You all take care now."

And Marie half-carried Lily as they made their way back.

Pearl cocked her head in Marina's direction. "What on Earth happened
there?"

Marina sighed, not turning to face her. "She jumped me when I got back
to the Square after getting those salts... Lily's phone had gotten a
message, but I didn't know who it was from until I got back down into
the sewers and was ambushed." She sighed and finally turned back to
Pearl and Eight. "Did you get much out of her?"

"A bit..." Pearl kicked the concrete ground in annoyance. "She's really
sticking to the idea that she doesn't know about Tartar or NILS at all.
Swears she *is* an Inkling now. Says she was brought to our time but not
of her own accord."

"Hm..." Marina thought quietly. *Something is still clearly up, but... I
guess it's possible she could, in fact, be a bystander of sorts...*

"Marina..." Pearl prodded her bandmate. "What did Marie mean? Who's
Octavio?"

"Ah... that's a bit of a long story," Marina said nervously, sharing a
glance with Agent Eight. "I guess we can tell it on the way back. Wanna
learn about my old boss?"

\*\*

Agent 4 checked her phone yet again. Still no messages. *Come on,
Lily...*

Since Lily had left about an hour and some ago, she had eagerly awaited
her next message, that would tell her she had made it to the Hideout.

But that message had not arrived. *She should have made it safely by
now... What if they had caught her?*

*What if she had never arri---*

The chime of the doorbell broke her chain of thought, and she panicked.
*Oh no, what if she was right, and* they are *here to... have words with
me?*

She grabbed her Hero Shot from the kitchen bench and inched her way over
to the door.

Slowly, quietly, in case she had to pretend she wasn't there, she looked
through the peephole.

And saw Marie, Callie, and... a battered Lily.

She quickly unlocked and opened the door, tossing her weapon aside. "Oh
my cod!" she cried out as she assisted them, guiding Lily to the couch
to crash. "What happened?!"

"She got ambushed beneath the Square," Marie told her. "They knew she
was going via the sewers. I'm glad I thought to come and find her, as
you can tell they got... pretty physical with her." The two sat on
either side of Lily, but Lorne quickly pulled her into an embrace while
Marie leaned forward to look into the girl's eyes. "Hey, you alright in
there? You've not said a word since I found you."

Lily turned her head slowly to look at her. Swallowing, she said, "They
beat me around the head kinda hard. The pain is making it hard to think
right now. But thank you for coming to help me. And sorry."

"Ssshhhh. You're fine." Marie rested her hand on her shoulder. "We know
you way better than they do. We've got your back."

As Marie told Lorne about what she had found in the sewers, Callie
placed her backpack down on the floor. Everything had (thankfully) been
left intact. The bag was a mess though - it was clear that everything
had been pulled out and then jammed back in. She did notice a lack of
something though... "Uhh, Lily's phones are missing," she announced to
the group.

"Oh, shit right..." Lily said, a little slowly as she nuzzled into
Lorne's shoulder. "Apparently Marina has them..."

"Oh, *joy*." Lorne sighed. "So, what now?"

"Well... First I rest up." Lily sighed deeply, noticing the pain was
beginning to dull. "And then I guess I'm just gonna have to sit down
with 'em and *prove* I'm no threat."

"And hopefully work out what the deal is with this Tartar nonsense,"
added Marie. "They seem to have Lily confused for some other person that
*is* or at least *was* a threat."

"But to do *this* to her?" Lorne gestured at her friend. "I thought
Pearl and Marina were better than this."

"I mean, if they were convinced she was a world-ending threat..." Callie
frowned. She was in the kitchenette, fixing everyone up glasses of milk
as she spoke. "Not that that makes it right, but..."

"Of course it doesn't!" Lorne said, raising her voice and startling Lily
slightly. "They should know better than to just... do what they did,
human or not!"

"*Marina* should know better," Marie corrected. "And maybe she does now,
now that we've shaken her up a bit. She'd've been in Lily's shoes when
she first arrived. Pearl, I'm not sure she gets it yet..."

"I don't know her as well as you two probably do," Lorne started, "but
she doesn't strike me as the type to think this sort of situation
through!"

Callie and Marie both made non-committal grunts. "It's hard to say,"
Callie said, as she handed out glasses of milk to the rest of the crew,
and sat on the couch arm next to Marie. "There are some things she does
really well, I mean she promoted Off the Hook on her own when they first
got together. And yeah, she got a little wild now and then, but this...
Maybe it's worth investigating this thing they keep mentioning, cous'."

"...Yeah, I think you're right." Marie thought for a moment, looking
intently at Lorne and Lily as she sipped at her milk glass. "Lily. Agent
5. Are... you still up for our kinda work? I know it's been real rough
today..."

Lily stared sleepily up at her, having curled up on the couch, her head
resting in Lorne's lap. She said simply, "I gotta..."

"Sure, but do you *want* to? Because if you do, I'll have a task for you
and Agent 4 that will involve this Tartar character."

Lily thought for a few long moments, but nodded. "I'll do what I can,"
she yawned, "to keep everyone safe."

Marie smiled, satisfied. "Alright," she began. "When you do go and see
Marina and Pearl again, first off I... think I'd like you to bring Four
with you as support. No need for you to be on your own again if things
go downhill. OK, Four?"

Lorne nodded. "I'd be glad to protect her."

"Secondly, I want you to find out from them what exactly happened with
Tartar, what NILS is, all that. Find out where they were last seen. Then
report back to us, and we'll all figure out where to go from there. That
sound good?"

Lily nodded silently.

"Cool. Don't worry, Lily. We've got your back."

"I wish Gramps were here..." Callie sighed. "His insight would be so
helpful..."

"Yeah..." Marie sighed. "He and Agent 3 have been gone for quite a while
now. I hope that their work has been going alright..."

"They know what they're doing. I bet they're doing just fine." Callie
smiled. "I just wish he'd get in touch..."

Marie nodded. "I hope he comes back soon. I'm sure he would love to meet
the new Agents."

"I would love to meet him one day," Lorne smiled at them. She had sat
Lily up, who was still looking a little groggy, and sipped at her glass.

Marie nodded again, and the apartment was quiet for a minute as everyone
drank up.

Lorne reached for the remote during this downtime and flicked on the TV.
There was a League battle being broadcast, whom three of the girls
recognised were two of the higher-ranked teams duking it out in a Tower
Control setting. The network was providing its own commentary.

"Oh, sweet!" Callie perked up. I haven't seen these guys playing in
ages. Mind if we watch?\" She asked Lorne.

"Not at all," Lorne smiled. "You a sports person, Lily?"

"This sorta sports, I could get into I think." Lily rubbed the back of
her head and found her gaze drawn to the television screen. She found
herself easily distracted by the battle unfolding.

"I heard you did pretty well for your first battle," Marie complimented,
glad the conversation was pivoting away from business. "Who knows, this
could be you one day."

"Funny."

"Well, keep training and battling and we'll see, mm?" Callie smiled at
her.

Everyone started to relax as they enjoyed the battles on TV. Callie and
Marie both ended up staying for dinner, ordering from the local "Fish's
Chip Takeaway" and enjoying some hot, deep-fried, crunchy chips with
their Agents.

When they finally said their farewells, well after the sun had set, the
mood had much improved, and Lily felt more confident that she might be
able to deal with Off the Hook.

And as she and Lorne got into bed for the night, she was once again
reminded of just how glad she was to have them as friends.

Lily just hoped the throbbing pain in her forehead would go away.
